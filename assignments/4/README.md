Do you like shark? With laser beams? Eating cupcakes? That makes their tails grow?

If so, do I know the game for you…

## Gameplay
That’s right! You move your little shark guy around with the arrow keys, attempting to hit the yummy cupcakes with your giant laser beam shooting out of your head. For every cupcake you eat (destroy with your laser) your tail grows. The point is to get a big long tail. Because that gives you points. Points are good. If you are a masochistic shark and shoot your own tail with your giant laser beam, well, you lose. So try not to do that.

I found all my images on Google Images using the advanced search to filter for transparent, GIFs, that were small.

Oh and for the laser, made a rotated version in Preview on my Mac. When I saved it from Preview it turned off the repeating, so I had to [user Gifsicle to turn that on again](http://superuser.com/a/169443)

```bash
$ brew install gifsicle
$ gifsicle -bl laserVertical.gif
```
